Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git allows you to alter different repositories without affecting the main source. Multiple people can
work on the same project with Git. It also allows for the main owner of the project to ensure a change is 
necessary prior to merging it with Main. It's an essential tool for group projects and every day coding.
